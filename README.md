## reflex-stripe

This is an integration between [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/elements) and [Reflex-DOM](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom) so you can use Stripe Elements within a Reflex-DOM application.

### Reflex-DOM fork warning

As of writing, this depends on a [fork of Reflex-DOM](https://github.com/ConferHealth/reflex-dom) which has not yet been [upstreamed](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom/pull/152). If you see complaints about missing `getMountStatus` / `MonadMountStatus`, that's why.
